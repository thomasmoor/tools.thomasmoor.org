Tools Website

This is the code of my website thomasmoor.org

The website provides online a choice of tools:
- YouTube Video Transcript: download the text of a YouTube video. I use this a lot to learn: when I find a video on YouTube I ant to learn from, I download the text of the video and follow then the video with the transcript. This helps me focus on the important points, without having to keep wriing down notes
- Movies Search: this tool lets the user search movies in the Internet Movies Database (Imdb.com) with search options that are not availalble on Imdb.com: for example all the movies that 2 cast members have made together
